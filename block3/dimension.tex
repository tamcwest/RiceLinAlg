\beginedxtext{Coordinatization as Linear Transformation}

{\keya{\bf{Proposition.}}}  If $\mathcal{B}  = \{v_1; v_2; \ldots ; v_n\}$ is a basis of $V$, then the
coordinatization map $C: V \rightarrow \R^n$ given by $C(w) = [w]_{\mathcal{B}}$ is a linear transformation
which is both into and onto.

\begin{edXshowhide}{Proof of Proposition}

To show that $C$ is a linear transformation...

In the video, we proved that $C$ is into and onto. 

\end{edXshowhide}



{\keya{\bf{Proposition.}}}  If $\mathcal{B}  = \{v_1; v_2; \ldots ; v_n\}$ is a basis of $V$, and $k>n$, then any list
of $k$ vectors in $V$ must be linearly dependent.

\beginedxproblem{Two Bases? 1}{\dpa1}


Recall the proposition we just proved: 

{\keya{\bf{Proposition.}}}  If $\mathcal{B}  = \{v_1; v_2; \ldots ; v_n\}$ is a basis of $V$, and $k>v$, then any list
of $k$ vectors in $V$ must be linearly dependent.  

Now suppose that $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis of $V$ with 5 vectors, and let $\mathcal{C}$ be a list of 7 vectors
in $V$.  Is it possible for $\mathcal{C}$ to be a basis of $V$?

\beginedxtext{Dimension Definition}

{\keya{\bf{Proposition.}}}  All bases of a vector space $V$ must have the same number of vectors.  
  

{\keya{\bf{Definition.}}}  
The {\keyb{\bf{dimension}}} of a vector space $V$ is defined to be the number of vectors in 
a basis of $V$.  If $V$ has no finite basis, we say that $V$ is infinite-dimensional.

{\keya{\bf{Proposition (A).}}}  If $\dim V = n < \infty$, and $W$ is any subspace of $V$, then any
linearly independent list of vectors in $W$ can be extended to form a basis of $W$.  

{\keya{\bf{Proposition.}}} If $\dim V = n$, then any linearly independent list of vectors in $V$ has
at most $n$ vectors.  Any linearly independent list of vectors in $V$ that has exactly $n$ vectors must
be a basis of $V$.  


{\keya{\bf{Proposition.}}} If $\dim V = n$, then any subspace $W$ of $V$ has dimension at most $n$.  
If $\dim W = n$, then $W = V$.  


{\keya{\bf{Proposition (B).}}} Any finite list of vectors that spans a vector space $V$ contains a basis of $V$.  

{\keya{\bf{Proposition.}}} If $\dim V = n$, then any list of vectors that spans $V$ has
at least $n$ vectors.  Any  list of vectors that spans $V$ that has exactly $n$ vectors must
be a basis of $V$.
